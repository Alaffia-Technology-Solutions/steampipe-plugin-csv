# CSV + Steampipe

A comma-separated values (CSV) file is a delimited text file that contains records of data.

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query data using SQL.

Query data from the `my_users.csv` file:

```sql
select
  first_name,
  last_name
from
  my_users
```

```
+------------+-----------+
| first_name | last_name |
+------------+-----------+
| Michael    | Scott     |
| Dwight     | Schrute   |
+------------+-----------+
```

## Documentation

- **[Table definitions & examples â†’](/plugins/turbot/csv/tables)**

## Get started

### Install

Download and install the latest CSV plugin:

```bash
steampipe plugin install csv
```

### Credentials

No credentials are required.

### Configuration

Installing the latest csv plugin will create a config file (`~/.steampipe/config/csv.spc`) with a single connection named `csv`:

```hcl
connection "csv" {
  plugin = "csv"
  paths  = [ "/path/to/your/files/*.csv" ]
}
```

- `paths` - A list of directory paths to search for CSV files. Paths may [include wildcards](https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath#Match). File matches must have the extension `.csv` (case insensitive).
- `separator` - Field delimiter when parsing files. Defaults to `,`.
- `comment` - Lines starting with this comment character are ignored. Disabled by default.
